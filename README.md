# Number Guessing Game

Simple Python number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and gives the user multiple attempts to guess it.

Usage
- Run interactively:

```powershell
python number_guessing_game.py
```

- Run the built-in non-interactive self-test:

```powershell
python -c "import number_guessing_game; number_guessing_game.self_test()"
```

The game provides feedback `Too low.` or `Too high.` and ends when the player guesses correctly or uses all attempts.
